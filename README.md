A machine learning-powered web application designed to recommend books to users based on collaborative filtering techniques. By analyzing underlying patterns in user reading histories and ratings, the system identifies similarities between books to provide highly accurate, personalized reading recommendations.

## ❓ What is Collaborative Filtering?

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MarpakaPradeepSai/Book-Recommendation-System/blob/main/Data/Images%20&%20GIF/CF2.webp?raw=true" alt="Collaborative Filtering" width="600"/>
</div>

**Collaborative filtering** is a technique used by recommender systems to predict a user's interests by collecting preferences from a broader user base. 

This project specifically utilizes **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**, which recommends items to a target user based on the similarities between the items themselves. If User A likes *Harry Potter 1*, and the system identifies that *Harry Potter 1* is mathematically similar to *Harry Potter 2* (because users who read the first almost always read the second), it will recommend the latter.

**Advantages:**
- 🎯 **User-Centric:** Adapts to complex, nuanced user behaviors.
- 🚫 **No Item Metadata Needed:** Doesn't rely on tags or genres.
- ✨ **Serendipity:** Helps users discover unexpected but highly relevant books.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Objective

Build a robust recommendation engine capable of processing millions of user interactions to suggest highly relevant books, deployed as a user-friendly web application.

<div align="center">

### 🛣️ Approach

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Core Algorithm** | Item-Based Collaborative Filtering |
| **Similarity Metric** | Cosine Similarity |
| **Sparsity Handling** | Threshold filtering (Active Users > 100 ratings, Popular Books > 50 ratings) |
| **Alternative Models Tested** | k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), K-Means Clustering |
| **Data Storage** | Hugging Face Datasets (`IamPradeep/BRS_DATA`) |
| **Deployment** | Streamlit Web Application |

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The project utilizes a comprehensive Book-Crossing dataset comprising three main components:

<div align="center">

| Component | Description | Volume |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Users** | Anonymized user IDs and demographic data (Location, Age). | 278,858 records |
| **Books** | ISBN, Title, Author, Year, Publisher, and Cover Image URLs. | 271,360 records |
| **Ratings** | Explicit ratings (1-10) and implicit ratings (0). | 1,149,780 records |

</div>

---

## 🔬 Methodology & Data Processing

### 🧹 1. Data Cleaning
- **Handling Outliers:** Detected and removed extreme outliers in the `Age` demographic using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to ensure clean demographic analysis.
- **Type Casting:** Cleaned invalid string entries in the `Year-Of-Publication` column and converted it to integer formats.
- **Missing Values:** Dropped rows with null `Book-Title` or `Book-Author` entries to ensure the final UI displays complete information.

### ⚖️ 2. Sparsity Reduction (The "Cold Start" Fix)
Recommendation matrices are notoriously sparse. To ensure high-quality recommendations and computational efficiency, the dataset was rigorously filtered:
1. **Active Users Only:** Filtered out users who rated fewer than **100 books**.
2. **Popular Books Only:** Filtered out books that received fewer than **50 ratings**.
3. **Result:** A dense, high-signal user-item pivot table ready for mathematical similarity calculations.

<br>

---

## ⚔️ Model Architecture & Evaluation

Three distinct approaches were evaluated to find the optimal recommendation engine:

### 🚀 1. Cosine Similarity (Deployed Model)
- **Mechanism:** Calculates the cosine of the angle between two projected vectors (books) in a multi-dimensional user space.
- **Why it was chosen:** Highly efficient, deterministic, and scales beautifully within Streamlit. Automatically normalizes for users who rate books more generously than others.

### 🤖 2. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- **Mechanism:** Utilized `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` with `metric='cosine'` and `algorithm='brute'`.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** `2.145`
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** `3.958`

### 📊 3. K-Means Clustering
- **Mechanism:** Unsupervised grouping of similar books.
- **Optimization:** Used the **Silhouette Score** to find the optimal number of clusters ($k=2$, score = `0.6518`).
- **Verdict:** While mathematically interesting, hard-clustering limits the nuanced, ranked recommendations required for a consumer-facing app compared to continuous similarity scoring.

## 💡 Key EDA Findings

Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed fascinating insights about reader behavior:

### 🏆 1. The Most Loved Books

<div align="center">

| Rank | Book Title | Perfect "10" Ratings | Insight |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| 1 | **The Da Vinci Code** | **160** | The undisputed highest-rated book in the dataset. |
| 2 | Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone | 152 | The *Harry Potter* series dominates the top 10, showing massive fan loyalty. |
| 3 | Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban | 150 | Consistent high ratings across the franchise. |
| 4 | The Lovely Bones | 148 | Highest-rated standalone fiction (non-franchise). |

</div>

<br>

### 📉 2. Rating Distributions & Engagement

*   **The Implicit Majority:** Over **647,294** interactions were implicit (a rating of 0, meaning the user interacted with the book but didn't leave a 1-10 score).
*   **Positivity Bias:** Among explicit ratings (1-10), **8 is the most common score**, indicating users are more likely to rate books they actually enjoyed.
*   **The "Wild Animus" Anomaly:** The book *Wild Animus* had the highest total occurrences (2,502) but overwhelmingly dominated the **"1-star"** rating category. High visibility does not equal high satisfaction!

<br>

### ✍️ 3. Industry Insights (Authors & Publishers)

<div align="center">

| Category | Top Entity | Volume | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Top Author** | **William Shakespeare** | 495 Books | Classic literature remains highly published. |
| **Top Contemp. Author** | **Agatha Christie** | 476 Books | Closely followed by Stephen King (332). |
| **Top Publisher** | **Harlequin** | 7,499 Books | Romance dominates mass-market publishing, far exceeding the #2 publisher (Silhouette at 4,183). |
| **Peak Publishing Era** | **1999 - 2002** | ~17k/year | The "Golden Era" of book releases within this specific dataset timeline. |

</div>

<br>

### 🌍 4. User Demographics
*   **Location:** The dataset is heavily skewed toward North America. **Toronto (13.3%)**, Seattle (11.7%), and Portland (11.2%) are the top user locations. London (8.7%) is the only non-North American city in the top 10.
